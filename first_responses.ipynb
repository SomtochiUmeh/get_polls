Too big a work and you risk gliding along the surface of a superficial analysis. Too small or trivial a work and there isn't anything to bite into.\\n\\n​\\n\\nYour video will consist of a slide deck and your narration. Make sure to follow the principles of #communicationdesign, #organization, #expression, and #designthinking in putting the video together.\\n\\n​\\n\\nYour interpretation should take into consideration the elements of the #medium as well as the #context of the work.\\n\\n​\\n\\nSubmit a PDF that includes:\\n\\n1. A link to your video, which you will upload on YouTube, labeled \\\"private\\\"\\n2. A link to or photographs of the work you analyzed\\n3. A list of HCs applied, with notes to explain, in 1-3 sentences, exactly why your work constitutes a strong application. For guidelines on how to integrate HCs in your work and write meaningful footnotes, please watch the “[++All About Footnotes++](https://youtu.be/yJEpVeLA260)” video from the Academic Foundations Series and see this guide, “[++Addressing HCs in your work++](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7yOVOtMIaHQdKLeRmZbq1gRqwJKfezBsfru9Q6PcHw/edit?usp=sharing)” (especially section 3).

If you go more than 30 seconds without illustrating a detail, you’ve gone too long without evidence.\\n- Practice delivering the narration while scrolling through the slides to make sure you record a polished presentation.\\n- A tutorial on creating a screencast with Quicktime can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwqUxDD0q3I).\\n- _In session 13, you will have a chance to workshop the slides and outline for your presentation. Make sure to __**start this project early**__ so that you can receive meaningful feedback during the workshop_.\\n\\n​\\n\\n**FAQs:**\\n\\nQ: Would it be ok to pick a work to analyze in a language other than English?\\n\\nA: Please ask your instructor who will be grading your assignment. If it's a language they know, they may approve. Do not analyze a non-English artwork without the instructor's prior approval.\\n\\n​\\n\\nQ: Can we analyze a video or movie?\\n\\nA: No, we will be studying #multimedia later in the semester. For this assignment, please choose from the #medium types we covered in class: literature, visual art, or music.\\n\\n​\\n\\nQ: Should we recite a poem in the video?\\n\\nA: 3-4 minutes is not very long. Unless the poem is very short, spending some of the video reciting the poem (or playing back a big chunk of music) might not be the best use of the allotted time. Make your best judgement about how much of the work to feature and how much analysis you provide in your narration.\\n\\n​\\n\\nQ: Is it ok if I speed up my narration to fit in the 3-4 minute range?\\n\\nA: Always keep in front of mind #expression and #audience. If your sped-up video is challenging to understand, you will risk getting a 1 or 2 on #expression and #audience.\\n\\n​\\n\\nQ: Should I include my face on the video?\\n\\nA: Include your face only if it is somehow relevant to your analysis (it's hard to imagine such a case). We will be grading #expression on the tone, pacing, and #confidence of your delivery, not on your facial expressions or body language.\\n\\n​\\n\\nQ: How might we tag #designthinking for this assignment?\\n\\nA: You should describe the process of working on and completing this project. How did you ideate, prototype, iterate? How did you make use of the feedback you received during the workshop session (session 13)?\\n\\n​\\n\\nQ: Where should I list my sources?\\n\\nA: You could have a bibliography or a sources cited list on your last slide or on the pdf you upload.\",\"description-format\":\"markdown\",\"description-url\":null,\"do-plagiarism-detection\":true,\"due-date\":\"2022-03-04T14:00:00Z\",\"extension-notifications-scheduled\":4,\"extension-notifications-sent\":4,\"grade-by\":\"2022-03-18T14:00:00Z\",\"group-count\":0,\"grouping\":\"\",\"is-due-date-overwritten\":false,\"is-description-overwritten\":false,\"is-group-assignment\":false,\"class\":null,\"length\":\"3 - 4 minutes\",\"module-updated-on\":null,\"muted\":false,\"num\":8048,\"publish-at\":\"2022-02-09T00:00:00Z\",\"published\":true,\"python-notebook\":null,\"section-id\":8339,\"section-title\":\"Carter, TTh@08:00AM Seoul\",\"scoring-category-default\":\"neither\",\"title\":\"Interpreting Art\",\"type\":\"iterative\",\"unmuted-at\":\"2022-03-10T16:29:30Z\",\"updated-on\":\"2022-03-10T16:29:30Z\",\"weight\":\"8x\"},\"class-event\":null,\"grader-user\":9136,\"class\":null,\"hc-item\":4379,\"poll\":null,\"poll-session\":null,\"target-assignment-group\":null,\"target-user\":11909,\"weight\":\"8x\"},{\"id\":1712603,\"active\":true,\"assignment-id\":null,\"broken-hc-key\":null,\"class-event-id\":40762429,\"comment\":\"I love that you give specific examples here!

(C) FA\",\"details\":\"An algorithm defines a set of steps that lead a given input to produce the desired output. The steps of a proper algorithm are well-ordered, clear, unambiguous, and effective (doable). Additionally, the algorithm should be robust enough to handle a range of inputs, rather than a small set of specific cases. It should also be as simple and efficient as possible, avoiding redundancies. Lastly, a proper algorithm should terminate in a finite number of steps. These properties can be achieved by systematically incorporating conditional steps (in which a decision must be made) and iteration (repeated steps), usually requiring careful testing and troubleshooting (“debugging”). Familiarity with various algorithmic strategies, such as brute-force methods, greedy algorithms, and divide-and-conquer approaches, can certainly broaden one’s problem-solving repertoire. These algorithmic strategies can be used to efficiently solve many real­-world problems, from connecting individuals on social media, to controlling self­-driving cars, to sequencing DNA. Algorithms are the most powerful when they can be interpreted and run by computers. Thus, writing and explaining computer code helps to boost one’s algorithmic thinking and problem-solving capabilities.\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/algorithms/\",\"hashtag\":\"#algorithms\",\"name\":\"algorithms\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":666,\"raw-name\":\"algorithms\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

Control groups are not subject to the independent variable or treatment of interest and are instead used as a baseline comparison and to identify the effect of extraneous variables (e.g., placebo treatment in a drug trial). Without an appropriate control group, results may be misleading or incomplete. Many studies use alternative comparison groups in addition to control groups. Comparison groups are also used when it is not possible to have a true control group. Alternative comparison groups test the effect of the independent variable in different ways (e.g., different doses of the same drug for one group of subjects vs. another or different levels of acidity in one part of the ocean compared to another). Choosing appropriate comparison groups can be difficult, therefore one must be able to identify the limitations of a particular comparison group and interpret the results accordingly.

(H) CX\",\"details\":\"As individuals, humans have been described as having a “herd instinct,” leading each of us to want to do what others are doing or what we think is expected of us. Human societies tend to develop norms - broad patterns of behaviors that operate as taken-for-granted rules for behaviors, the violation of which is frowned upon and often punished by social means (such as ostracism or naming and shaming). Social norms play an important role in a functioning society, though there will be cultural variation between societies. Though social norms are human creation, existing in the minds of people as perception of prevalent or appropriate behavior, they are persistent and self-reinforcing as individual deviations are seen as violations to be reproached or exceptions that prove the rule. And yet, social norms are regularly challenged at the margins, and they evolve, change, and are overthrown over time. Norm entrepreneurs are constantly organizing to make their convictions accepted as taken-for-granted default behaviors and they apply a variety of long-term strategies that are often called “theories of change.” Social change requires organizing because individuals can’t unilaterally change norms. However, as individuals, we should identify and be aware of norms and make choices about the extent to which we follow them. Conformity to the behavior of others or to social norms has benefits and is sometimes appropriate but it could also undermine creativity and effective problem-solving. Much research indicates that a “contrarian” perspective (going against the herd) can be an effective method for identifying new solutions and achieving goals. Yet contrarianism can sometimes be disruptive to the point of undermining progress. Learning to identify situations that invite conformity and determining when a contrarian approach is appropriate can help balance the impulse to “go along to get along.”\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/conformity/\",\"hashtag\":\"#conformity\",\"name\":\"conformity\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":806,\"raw-name\":\"conformity\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

Drawing statistical inferences about a population from sample data often requires a “sampling distribution,” a theoretical distribution of the values of a specified statistic (i.e., mean, proportion) over all possible random samples of a specific size that can be made from a given population.

Leaders are thus often required or expected to set aside adherence to general rules and norms that apply to group members. At the same time, leaders are also judged on how well they articulate and embody their group’s identity and core values. If they disregard these, they risk undermining the group’s cohesion and their own credibility. Importantly, history teaches that almost all of a leader’s shortcomings will be forgiven if they realize their group’s objectives. A central challenge of leadership thus consists in actually achieving a group’s goals, however ambitious, without undermining the group’s identity or values.

(C) CX\",\"details\":\"Network analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the relationships or connections among agents within a system. For example, analysis of these networks can help us understand how ideas, resources, information, or diseases propagate through a social system. Network analysis begins with an explicit definition of the nodes in the network and the criteria for determining which nodes are connected by edges. Of particular interest are social networks, where nodes represent individuals. In this context, edges might represent friendship, communication, physical proximity, authority, or some other relevant social relationship. Analyzing network structures can help illuminate phenomena that cannot be explained by relying on the characteristics of individuals. A student may be the most influential trendsetter of their class not because they are the most innovative, outgoing or charismatic - but simply because of their location in the network of connections. If the structure of the network would change, because other students have formed new relationships, the trendsetter may lose their position of influence. Such a phenomenon is called a network effect.\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/networks/\",\"hashtag\":\"#networks\",\"name\":\"networks\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":470,\"raw-name\":\"networks\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

One key strategy employed in biology is teleological or adaptationist thinking, where we posit that a trait serves some function that benefits the organism’s survival and reproduction. This type of reasoning can help us to understand why some mechanisms function as they do, and it can help us to generate testable hypotheses. However, we need to be cautious when applying adaptationist reasoning, as many traits may exist due to historical accident or as a byproduct of selection for some other trait. Similarly, some traits that are the direct products of natural selection may be serving some purpose different from simple survival and reproduction of the individual organism. A second important element of evolutionary reasoning is phylogenetic thinking. Genes and traits present in contemporary organisms are mostly derived from genes and traits that were present in some form in the common ancestor of multiple species.

One element of genetic architecture is dominance, or how different combinations of alleles at a single locus affect the phenotype. Loss-of-function mutations are often recessive, but there are also cases of haploinsufficiency, as well as other types of mutations, which can result in other, more complex, dominance patterns. Epistasis refers to non-additive interactions among alleles at different loci, while pleiotropy is the phenomenon where variation at a single locus affects more than one “trait.” Patterns of dominance, epistasis, and pleiotropy can suggest particular relationships at the molecular level (such as the order in which gene products act in a biochemical pathway). Most phenotypes are also affected by environmental variation. Genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction occurs when genetic and environmental variants combine with non-linear effects on the phenotype. The study of GxE interactions can be complicated by GxE association, where genotypes are not randomly assorted into different environments. One common measure of the importance of genetic variation in determining phenotypic variation is the “heritability.” However, it is important to keep in mind that measures of heritability depend on the extent of both genetic and environmental variability, and are therefore only meaningful within that particular context.\",\"example\":\"Old Rubric Level 4: (when applicable) Accurately analyzes phenotypic ratios and explains the principles behind the determination of genotypes, allele status and/or mode of inheritance; (when applicable) accurately designs complex genetic crosses and accurately predicts their results; (when applicable) accurately explains the relationship between patterns of inheritance and molecular mechanisms; (when applicable) accurately evaluates and explains the principles behind the determination of the influence of genes and environment on phenotypic variation; (when applicable) accurately critiques or designs a sophisticated experiment to determine gene and environmental effects on phenotypic variation.\",\"hashtag\":\"#ns144_geneticarchitecture\",\"name\":\"ns144_geneticarchitecture\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":571,\"raw-name\":\"ns144-geneticarchitecture\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

When designing or evaluating a study, the underlying research question and the unique features of different study populations will guide the choice of appropriate subjects and interpretation of results. Study populations can be considered at different levels of biological organization. For instance, at the cellular level, you may want to compare levels of expression of a gene in a metabolic pathway in different cell types. The study population for such a study might be kidney and liver cells. At the population level, you may compare populations with a high vs. low prevalence of a condition, or select a family pedigree with a known history of a syndrome. At the species level, model organisms have the potential to illuminate mechanisms and principles that may not be tractable in humans. For instance, much of what is known about eukaryotic gene regulation was studied in yeast. But if your ultimate goal is understanding human biology, you need to consider trade-offs between the ease of working with the model organism and the ability to generalize to humans. You also want to include practical considerations, such as the existence of well developed tools for working with the system, the organism’s generation time, and the cost of maintaining or accessing a population of sufficient size to answer your question.\",\"example\":\"Old Rubric Level 4: Accurately determines the characteristics of a study population relevant to its use for research and explains why these characteristics are important; (when applicable) accurately selects an appropriate study population for a specific study and provides a thorough rationale and/or justification; (when applicable) accurately critiques the selection of a study population for a specific study and provides a thorough rationale and/or justification.\",\"hashtag\":\"#ns144_studypopulation\",\"name\":\"ns144_studypopulation\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":571,\"raw-name\":\"ns144-studypopulation\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

Once the problem is defined, an appropriate optimization process or technique that describes how to achieve the optimal solution must be chosen.

This quantity indicates how much of the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the regression model. Multiple regression enables one to make predictions about the response variable conditional on values of more than one predictor variable, and make inferences about the relationship between a single predictor and the outcome variable when holding all other predictors constant.

This requires objectivity, intellectual courage, and lack of arrogance so that you can form an accurate appraisal of your strengths and weaknesses as well as develop strategies for self-improvement.

(H) CX\",\"details\":\"IIncentives, disincentives, rewards, punishments, and choice architecture are tools for shaping behavior. We divide the tools for shaping behaviors into three categories, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses: (dis)incentives, reward/punishment, and choice architecture. \\n\\nIncentives and disincentives change agents’ behavior by altering the expected utility payoff of the choices they face. Thus, incentives and disincentives rely on the model of rational agents who aim to maximize their expected utility and operate as promises (of reward) and threats (of punishment), aiming to encourage or discourage a behavior before it takes place. (Dis)incentives are successful if they motivate agents to engage or avoid certain behaviors. \\n\\nIn contrast, rewards and punishments are administered after an action. Rewards and punishments aim to teach agents what behaviors lead to better and worse results, and they are successful when agents are more likely to engage in the rewarded behavior and less likely to engage in a punished one. \\n\\nChoice architecture influences behavior by manipulating the way options are presented. It uses psychological influence that ‘nudges’ humans separately from their utility calculations without altering the available choices. Choice architecture has a measurable and reliable impact with a large enough sample size. Choice architecture works by affecting agents’ choices in ways that they are not typically aware of, and therefore it raises ethical concerns.\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/shapingbehavior/\",\"hashtag\":\"#shapingbehavior\",\"name\":\"shapingbehavior\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":480,\"raw-name\":\"shapingbehavior\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

The dimensions of a phase space (similar to axes on a graph) describe measurable features of the system that can increase or decrease over time.

Attractors can be described as surrounded by basins of attraction, representing a range of values on the dimensions that are likely to move towards the attractor in the basin.

(C) CX\",\"details\":\"There is no obvious way to “carve nature at its joints” (Plato); in creating a representation, a ‘map,’ of complex systems we make conceptual choices about the way in which we represent reality. Just like a map can represent a geographical reality by distinguishing topographical or political features, the way we dissect any particular system depends on, and should be guided by, the purpose of inquiry, which in empirical research is the explanatory challenge we face. Complex systems can be deconstructed in a variety of ways that define both the scope of the system as well as the relevant attributes of its components (in social systems, most commonly, people). Thus, the key part of deconstructing a system is conceptualizing its constituent parts in several ways in order to choose or synthesize the ‘mapping’ of the system that is most appropriate for addressing the explanatory challenge. For example, in analyzing a football team one might think of players in terms of their position on the field, their running speed or their personality types. Depending on the question at hand, one may or may not include the players’ personal trainers, the team’s management or even the fans. One specific application of this concept is considering organizational structure: there are various ways in which the same group of people and functions may be related to one another, such as a strict hierarchy, a matrix or a flat structure.\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/systemmapping/\",\"hashtag\":\"#systemmapping\",\"name\":\"systemmapping\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":470,\"raw-name\":\"systemmapping\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

(C) FA\",\"details\":\"Lying at the heart of decision theory is the concept of utility, an abstraction that represents the amount of satisfaction an individual derives from an outcome. If we assume that decision-making is purposeful action aimed at realizing pre-existing preferences, we can use the concept of utility to formalize the content of these preferences and relate them to outcomes. Specifically, a utility function serves as a mathematical model that describes one’s preferences by mapping the value of outcomes (e.g. time, money) to a particular individual’s derived satisfaction by attaching a value to each of the possible outcomes. The most common applications of utility hinge on an assumption that agents are rational, meaning that their utility function adheres to certain properties (e.g., consistency, transitivity). In the context of decision making, agents are typically thought of as utility maximizers. This means that when sufficient information is available to quantify outcomes and corresponding probabilities, a decision maker will choose the option with the maximal “expected utility,” which is the probability-weighted average utility of an action. Personal characteristics, such as risk preferences and cognitive biases are represented by utility functions with different shapes and can further affect one’s expected utility by skewing the perception of probabilities. Common tendencies to be aware of include risk-seeking and risk-averse attitudes, distorting probabilities, disproportionately weighting losses versus gains, and inconsistently valuing utilities over time. Evaluating utility, utility functions, and expected utilities can help one analyze decision-making scenarios from both an empirical and a normative perspective.\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/utility/\",\"hashtag\":\"#utility\",\"name\":\"utility\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":159,\"raw-name\":\"utility\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.

To do so, one must identify and classify the relevant variables, examine the relationships between them, and consider how they can be measured and manipulated. In the context of a study or experiment, this typically involves identifying which features play the role of independent variables, the hypothesized predictors, and which play the role of the dependent variable, the hypothesized response that results from changes in the independent variable(s). One may also need to identify confounding variables that could impact the relationship under study, and carefully consider how to mitigate their effects. Further, classifying the type of variables (for example, qualitative or quantitative) is essential as it will affect the type of statistical analyses that are appropriate. Representing a problem formally may also involve identifying the quantities that are constant (not varying), usually referred to as parameters. Parameters help to define the nature of the problem and can be treated as constraints on the solution.\",\"example\":\"To learn more about this HC, including examples, tips for strong applications, self-study questions, and common pitfalls, review its HC Handbook page: https://my.minerva.edu/academics/hc-resources/hc-handbook/variables/\",\"hashtag\":\"#variables\",\"name\":\"variables\",\"outcome-type\":\"glo\",\"parent\":160,\"raw-name\":\"variables\",\"rubric\":\"[{\\\"score\\\": 0, \\\"title\\\": \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"No data.\\\"}, {\\\"score\\\": 1, \\\"title\\\": \\\"Not Assessable\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Not enough information is present to determine whether there is any understanding or mastery of the learning outcome.
